Hi, I'm Joe (승현).

I’m an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto and an ML Research Intern at Huawei Canada.

My current focus is at the intersection of Computer Vision (Huawei) and Reinforcement Learning (DORL Lab, UofT). I hope to work at the intersection of these two fields
in the future.

I try to live by Charlie Munger's words of wisdom:

"Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day—if you live long enough—like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve."

I am fortunate enough to work in something that interests me, but still early in my journey.

I’ve also found that true expertise doesn't come from a job title; it comes from the hours spent breaking, fixing things, and rebuilding them from scratch.

When I’m not at my desk, I’m likely making some coffee or playing
the electric guitar.
