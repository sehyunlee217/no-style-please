## Vancouver:

[Revolver](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sz4zySexryJYKMi99)

- Located near Gastown, it is my favorite cafe of all time.
- Pastries are not great here; tasting flight is ok but on the expensive side - get the latte please.
- Best Drink: latte (**warm** not iced)

- Located near Fraser & King Edward. Good Coffee, cool interior design
  but not a lot of seats available and usually very busy.
- Best Drink: cappuccino

## Toronto:

[Everyday Gourmet Coffee Roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RLsaoqoZSEJgrozU7)

- Located in St.Lawrence market.
- Where I purchase my beans (Yirgacheffe) ~ $10 for 200grams
- The coffee they serve is good but on the more acidic side.
- Probably one of the only places left in Toronto where you can get a latte for $4.

[Butter & Blue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3nxRjEuRZNP37azQ9)

- Near UofT campus. Has a outdoor patio during the summer and very friendly staff.
- Also pretty busy, good coffee but I always get the milk tea.
- Best Drink: hong kong milk tea (iced)

[Carbonic Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evrmKJgQ61jE1ZRFA)

- Right next to Butter & Blue. First cafe I've been in Toronto.
- Great coffee but not sure about the non-coffee drinks.
- I don't think there is AC in the summer.
- Best Drink: cortado

[White Squirrel Coffee Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2kBUAz9nPBW9tdCKA)

- Across from Trinity Bellwoods park. Also sells icecream.
- Not a lot of seating options but good for take-out and heading to the park right after.
- Also a bit on the more acidic side.
- Best Drink: iced latte

[Fahrenheit Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hDHAprEnsDuUUNPg6)

- Multiple locations across Toronto, a wide variety of bean options.
- Diablo ~ acidic & chocolaty / Ethiopian ~ fruity
- The baristas are pretty consistent and good here.
- The location here is really really small though.
- Best Drink: cortado
